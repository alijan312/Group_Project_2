# Group_Project_2

Project Proposal:
    We will create a searchable database of pets for adoption. There are such sited existing already, but we have the overall user experience to be lacking. They could use a more appealing homepage, better explainations and, most importantly, a good searching function.

* Use a Node and Express Web Server;

* Be backed by a MySQL Database an ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);
    We will employ MySQL to create a searchable database of animals for adoption.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;
    We will use get get routes for our pet search. We will use post routes when useres register their information to our database.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);

* Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed;
    Make use of the newer Moment time library to create time stamps on user registrations.

* Have a polished frontend / UI;

* Have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm;

* Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).
    We will use Eslint

* Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server, see [Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md](../../../10-nodejs/03-Supplemental/Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md)
    Will use .env to disguise sensitve API information
