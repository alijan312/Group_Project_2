                <ol class="custom pl-0">
                    <li>Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets</li>
                    <li>Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated</li>
                    <li>Elevate the status of pets to that of family member</li>
                </ol>
